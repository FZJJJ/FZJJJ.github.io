尊敬的老师：

早上好！我是西北工业大学的冯梓健，我来自于河南省驻马店市。很荣幸能参加本次的面试，下面我将从学业情况，科研竞赛，课外活动三个方面来介绍自己。

首先，在学业方面，我本科的专业是材料科学与工程。经历前三年的学习，目前我的绩点为3.693，专业排名为15，且已经通过了国家英语四六级，并且多次获得“优秀大学生”、校二级奖学金等，预计能够获得本专业保研资格。经过三年的探索，我发现自己的兴趣在于计算机方向，因此我希望能在研究生时攻读深度学习的相关方向。

其次，在科研与竞赛方面，除去在材料方面做的科研，在计算机方面，我都是大三获得的奖项，比如：蓝桥杯A组省级二等奖，校程序设计实验技能竞赛一等奖，校数学建模比赛三等奖。在科研方面，我大多是出于兴趣自己做的项目，比如“基于深度学习的风格迁移”，采用了Pytorch框架和VGG神经网络，对风格和内容损失函数进行梯度下降，以达到迁移的目的。还有“基于yolov5的口罩识别”，该项目主要采用yolov5算法实现了对于口罩的图片、视频的实时监测。

最后，在课外活动方面，我担任过班级的学习委员，担任过学院新媒体的副部长，与此同时，我也经常在校内进行一些志愿互动。在生活中，我喜欢看话剧，听音乐，打乒乓球，同时也喜欢钻研配置计算机的工具。

以上就是我的自我介绍，十分感谢老师的倾听！

Dear teacher:

Good morning! I am Feng Zijian from Northwestern Polytechnical University, and I am from Zhumadian City, Henan Province. I am honored to participate in this interview. Now I will introduce myself from three aspects: academic situation, scientific research competition and **extracurricular** activities.

First of all, in terms of academics, my undergraduate major is materials science and engineering. After the first three years of study, my current GPA is 3.693, my professional ranking is 15, and I have passed the national English level 4 and 6, and have won the "Excellent College Student" and the school's second-level scholarship for many times.  After three years of exploration, I found that my interest lies in the computer field, so I hope to pursue a related field of deep learning in graduate school.

Secondly, in terms of scientific research and competitions, except for the scientific research in materials, in terms of computer, I have won awards in my junior year, such as: the second prize at the provincial level in the Blue Bridge Cup Group A, and the first prize in the school programming experiment skills competition, and the third prize of the school mathematical modeling competition. In terms of scientific research, I mostly do my own projects out of interest, such as "Style Transfer Based on Deep Learning", which uses the Pytorch framework and VGG-19 **neural** network to perform gradient **descent** on the style and content loss functions to achieve the purpose of transfer. There is also "mask recognition based on yolov5", which mainly uses the yolov5 **algorithm** to realize real-time monitoring of pictures and videos of masks.

Finally, in terms of **extracurricular** activities, I have served as the study committee member of the class and the vice minister of new media in the college. At the same time, I often have some volunteer interactions in the school. In life, I like to watch dramas, listen to music, play table tennis, and also like to study the tools for configuring computers.

The above is my self-introduction, thank you very much for listening!
